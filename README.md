# GravitoCode

## Overview
Welcome to **GravitoCode**! This repository is dedicated to implementing **numerical methods** and **physics simulations**, with a special focus on:
- **General Relativity**
- **Numerical Integration**
- **Classical Mechanics**

The goal of this project is to provide an **intuitive, structured, and interactive** way to understand and apply these concepts using **Mathematica** and **Python**.

## Introduction
**GravitoCode** is a collection of **numerical techniques** and **physics-based simulations** designed for students, researchers, and enthusiasts who want to explore these methods programmatically. It covers:
- **Solving Differential Equations**
- **Performing Numerical Integrations**
- **Simulating Real-World Physics Problems**

**Languages Used:**  
- **Mathematica** (symbolic & numerical computations)
- **Python** (scientific computing & data analysis)

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is divided into three main sections:

### 1. Differential Equations
- Euler’s Method  
- Runge-Kutta 4 Method  

### 2. Numerical Integration
- Monte Carlo Method  
- Simpson’s Rule  
- Trapezium Rule  

### 3. Physics Simulations
- Escape Velocity from Earth Simulation  
- Kepler’s Laws Simulations  
- SHM (Simple Harmonic Motion) Simulations  

**Note:** *General Relativity Computation has a separate README.*
